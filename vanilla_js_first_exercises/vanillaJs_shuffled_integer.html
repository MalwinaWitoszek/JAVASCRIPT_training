        // exercise from Codility:

        // There is a company that has a very creative way of managing its accounts.
        // Every time they want to write down a number, they shuffle its digits
        // in the following way: they alternatively write one digit from
        // the front of the number and one digit from the back, then the second digit
        // from the front and the second from the back, and so on until
        // the length of the shuffled number is the same as that of the original.
        // Write a function
        // function solution(A);
        // that, given a positive integer A, returns its shuffled representation.
        // For example, given A = 123456 the function should return 162534.
        // Given A = 130 the function should return 103.
        // Assume that:
        // â€¢ A is an integer within the range [0..100,000,000].
        // In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution
        // will not be the focus of the assessment.


        const solution = A => {
            let arrInteger = A.toString().split('');
            let shuffledArray = [];
            for (let digit = 0, max = arrInteger.length; digit < max; digit++) {
                shuffledArray.push(arrInteger[0]);
                arrInteger.splice(0, 1);
                arrInteger = arrInteger.reverse();
            }
            return parseInt(shuffledArray.join(''), 10);

        }

        let number = solution(103);
        console.log(number)
        let number2 = solution(354697);
        console.log(number2)
